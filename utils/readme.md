# New .v4p patch in context menu
In order to work .bat file need to be run as admin. There's also an entry which modifies friendly filetype name from "|||| VVVV Patch" to simply "VVVV Patch". Sebescudie pointed out that the '|' characters made windows apeshit and that's why it wasn't working before. Big thanks for him.
